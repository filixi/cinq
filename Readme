Cinq is a header only, modern C++ library. This library has no third-party dependency.

This project planned to provide identical API and functionality in lastest successive two C++ standards(currently C++17 and C++14).

It will consist of multiple mostly interchangebale versions. The internal implementation will be largly different across different versions, but the API and functionality will be mostly identical.

V1 doesn't support lazy evaluation, but with the best error message when something goes wrong and the most intuitive internal implementation.
Only a little template is used in V1, thus stepping through it is more pleasant than the other versions.

V2 will use type erasure to support lazy evaluation, thus it comes with the overhead of virtual function call. It will also use more templates internally comparing to V1. Stepping through cinq-v2 during debugging will thus requires more efforts.

V3 is basically V2 but without using type erasure. It is armed heavily with templates. It will support lazy evalution and multipass.

The first release will be only V3 and likely V1, and will require C++17 to compile.
