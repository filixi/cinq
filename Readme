Cinq (C++ inline query) is a header only, modern C++ library with no third-party dependency.

This library is inspired by Linq of C#. It will provide similar APIs and functionalities as Linq and PLinq along with extensions and adapations to meet best-practices of modern C++.

This project plans to provide identical API and functionality in lastest successive two C++ standards (currently C++17 and C++14), and focuses on easy-to-use and performance.

The first relase will require C++17 to compile. (If we are lazy enough, C++14 might never get supported :P)

The following cinq version is provided:

Cinq - default to VCinqEx

CinqEx - full template version, minimum run-time overhead, maximum compile-time overhead(CPU, memory, disk).
SCinq - Slim version, no lazy-evaluation
VCinq - Virtual version, no type information is preserved, maximum run-time overhead, minimum compile-time overhead.
VCinqEx - Virtual version with some type information preserved, moderate run-time overhead, moderate compile-time overhead.
PCinq - Parallel Cinq using VCinqEx.
PCinqEx - Parallel Cinq using Cinq

Warning:
Building the test in non parallel mode requires 6Gib memory and 2Gib disk space.
