Cinq (C++ inline query) is a header only, modern C++ library with no third-party dependency.

This library is inspired by Linq of C#. It will provide similar APIs and functionalities as Linq and PLinq along with extensions and adaptations to meet best-practices of modern C++.

This project plans to provide identical API and functionality in lastest successive two C++ standards (currently C++17 and C++14), and focuses on easy-to-use and performance.

The first relase will require C++17 to compile, and will only support a subset of the variations. (If we are lazy enough, C++14 might never get supported :P)

Warning:
Depend on the settings, building the test in non parallel mode requires up to 6GiB memory and 10GiB disk space.
