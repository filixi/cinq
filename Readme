Cinq(C++ integrated query, or five in france) is a header only, modern C++ library. This library has no third-party dependency.

It's planned to provide identical API and functionality in both C++11 and C++17.

It contains multiple mostly interchangebale versions. The internal implementation is different across different versions, but the API and functionality is mostly identical.

V1 doesn't support lazy evaluation, but with the best error message and the most intuitive internal implementation.
Only a little template is used in V1, thus stepping through it is more pleasant than the others. And the error message is also more friendly.
-V1 does not support lazy evaluation, thus the result of every query is evaluted instantly.

V2 is, can't say more performant, more sophicated. It use type erasure to support lazy evaluation, thus it comes with the overhead of virtual function call. It also use more template internally compare to V1, stepping through it during debugging will thus requires more efforts.

V3 is the most performant version and is armed heavily with templates. It supports lazy evalution and multipass. But as .Net, multipass will cause re-evaluation.

V4 is V3 with caching to reduce the overhead of multipass. But re-evaluation is not totally eliminated.

V5 is basically V1 + V3. The result will be stored as evaluated.

The first release will only contains V1 and V3, and supports only C++17.
